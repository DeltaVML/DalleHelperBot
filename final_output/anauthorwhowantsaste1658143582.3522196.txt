DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: A book cover.
DALLE: What kind of book?
CUSTOMER: A steamy romance.
DALLE: I'm sorry, but I can't do sexual images.
CUSTOMER: Okay, can you make it look like they're about to kiss then?
DALLE: Sure.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: A man and woman are standing close together, their faces inches apart. Both look passionately into each other's eyes, and it looks like they are about to kiss.
