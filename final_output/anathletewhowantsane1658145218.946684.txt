DALLE: Okay, well let me ask you some questions about the scene and setting. What kind of environment do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't really know. Somewhere outdoors I guess.
DALLE: Okay, what kind of lighting do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Whatever looks good.
DALLE: All right, well let me ask you about the subject. What do you want to be featured in the image?

DALLE: In the image, the customer is standing against a backdrop of an outdoor scene, possibly a soccer field. They are fully decked out in their soccer gear, and look powerful and strong. The lighting is natural and flattering, and the image overall gives off a feeling of strength and determination.
