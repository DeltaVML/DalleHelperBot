DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: Well, I work in an office and I'm looking for something to spruce up my cubicle.
DALLE: Okay, what kind of job do you have?
CUSTOMER: I'm an administrative assistant.
DALLE: And what's the company culture like?
CUSTOMER: It's pretty corporate.
DALLE: So you're looking for something that's corporate-appropriate?
CUSTOMER: Yeah, but I also want it to reflect my personality.
DALLE: What's your personality like?
CUSTOMER: I'm pretty laid-back.
DALLE: Okay, so you don't want anything too serious.
CUSTOMER: No, nothing too stuffy.
DALLE: How about a landscape?
CUSTOMER: That could work.
DALLE: What kind of landscape?
CUSTOMER: I don't know...something pretty?
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: A landscape painting with rolling hills, green grass, and a few trees. The sky is a bright blue with some white clouds.
