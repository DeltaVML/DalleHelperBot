DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We're a group of D&D players and we want a piece of group art.
DALLE: Okay, I can definitely do that. Can you tell me a little more about your characters? What races and genders are they?
CUSTOMER: We have a human woman, a dwarf man, an elf man, and a halfling woman.
DALLE: That sounds great. Can you tell me what kind of campaign you're in? Is it a high fantasy setting or more of a gritty realism game?
CUSTOMER: It's a high fantasy setting.
DALLE: Okay, so you'll probably want something with a lot of color then. Do you have any particular scene or subject in mind?
CUSTOMER: We're thinking something like our characters standing triumphantly over a pile of dead dragons.
DALLE: That sounds awesome. Can you tell me what kind of feeling you want the piece to have?
CUSTOMER: We want it to be really epic and heroic, like our characters are the only ones who could have defeated the dragons.
DALLE: I can definitely do that. Can you tell me what kind of effects you want? For example, do you want the dragons to be on fire?
CUSTOMER: That would be really cool.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: In the image, four adventurers stand triumphantly over a pile of dead dragons. The human woman, dwarf man, elf man, and halfling woman all look heroic and fierce, as if they are the only ones who could have defeated the dragons. The dragons are all on fire, adding to the feeling of epic heroism.
