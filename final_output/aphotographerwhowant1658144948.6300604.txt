DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want something nature-themed, but I'm not sure what kind of scene or setting I want.
DALLE: Okay, well, let's start with the basics. What kind of feeling do you want your scene to convey?
CUSTOMER: I want it to feel peaceful and calming.
DALLE: Alright. And what kind of effects are you looking for?
CUSTOMER: I don't really know. Something different, I guess.
DALLE: Different how?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Maybe something from a different perspective?
DALLE: Okay, so you want something that's not just a traditional landscape photo. You want something a little more unique.
CUSTOMER: Yeah, that sounds right.
DALLE: Well, one option is to use a different kind of camera lens. I have a fisheye lens that can distort the scene and give it a really different look.
CUSTOMER: That sounds interesting. Can you show me some examples?
DALLE: Unfortunately I can't show you examples over chat, but I can make some suggestions.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The image is of a traditional landscape scene, but from a fish eye perspective. This perspective makes the scene look different and unique.
