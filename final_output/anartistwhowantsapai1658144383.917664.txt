DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I need a painting of my favorite animal.
DALLE: What is your favorite animal?
CUSTOMER: I can't decide. I like tigers, lions, and bears.
DALLE: Okay, let's narrow it down. What is your favorite of those three animals?
CUSTOMER: I like tigers the best.
DALLE: Great! What would you like the painting to look like?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I just want it to look like my favorite animal.
DALLE: Do you want it to be a realistic painting or more of an abstract one?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What are my options?
DALLE: I can do a realistic painting or an abstract one.
CUSTOMER: Can you show me some examples?
DALLE: Sure. (DALLE shows the CUSTOMER some examples of their work)
CUSTOMER: I like the realistic painting.
DALLE: Okay, great. What kind of background do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. What are my options?
DALLE: I can do a natural background or a more artificial one.
CUSTOMER: What's the difference?
DALLE: A natural background would be something like a forest or a Jungle. An artificial background would be something like a cityscape or a blank canvas.
CUSTOMER: I want a natural background.
DALLE: Okay, great. What kind of setting do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. What are my options?
DALLE: I can do a day or night setting.
CUSTOMER: I want a day setting.
DALLE: Okay, great. Is there anything else you want to include in the painting?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What are my options?
DALLE: I can include other animals, people, or objects in the painting if you'd like.
CUSTOMER: I don't want any people or other animals in the painting.
DALLE: Okay. Is there anything else you can think of that you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: No, I don't think so.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The painting is of a tiger in a jungle setting. The background is of a dense forest with tall trees. The tiger is in the middle of the painting, facing the viewer. The tiger is lying down on the ground with its head up. Its eyes are closed and it has a peaceful expression on its face.
