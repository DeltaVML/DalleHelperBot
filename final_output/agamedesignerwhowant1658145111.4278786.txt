DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a landscape for a video game I'm working on, but I don't know what kind of style I want or what kind of location would be best.
DALLE: Okay, well let's start with the basics then. What's the scene about?
CUSTOMER: It's a post-apocalyptic world where the only survivors are fighting each other for resources.
DALLE: Okay, so you're looking for something that looks ruined and despondent?
CUSTOMER: Yeah, I want it to look like there's no hope left.
DALLE: Got it. And what kind of mood do you want to convey?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be intimidating and foreboding.
DALLE: Okay, so dark and creepy then. Got it. And what about the style? Are you looking for something realistic or more abstract?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What are my options?
DALLE: Well, we could go for a realistic style, or we could go for something more stylized. Or we could even do a mixture of both.
CUSTOMER: I don't know. What do you think would work best?
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The image is of a post-apocalyptic landscape. The ground is barren and dry, with mountains in the distance. There is a storm brewing, and the sky is dark and foreboding. The mood is one of despair and hopelessness.
