DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I need a landscape for my new game.
DALLE: What kind of landscape?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Something that looks like a cross between Skyrim and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
DALLE: Okay, what kind of feel are you going for?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be peaceful and scenic, but with a feeling of adventure.
DALLE: Any particular color scheme you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be very bright and vibrant.
DALLE: Any other specific requirements?
CUSTOMER: I need it to be high resolution so it looks good on a 4K monitor.

CUSTOMER: Oh okay
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: A high resolution image that is a cross between Skyrim and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The landscape is peaceful and scenic, but with a feeling of adventure. The color scheme is very bright and vibrant.
