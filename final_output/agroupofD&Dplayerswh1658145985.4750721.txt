DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We're looking for a group art of our D&D characters.
DALLE: Okay, I can definitely do that. Can you tell me a little bit more about your characters? Their races, genders, and what kind of campaign you're playing.
CUSTOMER: We have a mix of races and genders. Our campaign is a home game set in a homebrew world.
DALLE: That sounds great. Are there any specific scenes or settings you want me to include?
CUSTOMER: We'd like a portrait of our characters, maybe in a tavern or something like that.
DALLE: Okay, I can definitely do that. Are there any specific poses or angles you want me to use?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. Whatever you think would look best.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The image will be a portrait of the customer's D&D characters in a tavern setting. The characters will be of various races and genders, and the exact pose and angle will be up to the artist.
