DALLE: A close-up of a woman's face with bright, vibrant makeup. The focus is on the eyes, which are heavily shadowed and lined in a deep, rich black. The lashes are thick and long, with a dramatic winged effect. The rest of the face is fairly natural, with a light pink blush on the cheeks and a nude lipstick. There is a small tag on the side of the image with the cosmetics brand name.
