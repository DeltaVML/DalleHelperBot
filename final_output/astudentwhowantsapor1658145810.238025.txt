DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I need a family portrait.
DALLE: Okay, let's get started. How many people are in your family?
CUSTOMER: Five.
DALLE: Okay, and can you tell me a little bit about your family?
CUSTOMER: We're a mixed race family. My parents are from different countries and we have three kids.
DALLE: That sounds like a really interesting family! I'm sure I could come up with a really great portrait for you. Can you tell me a little bit about what kind of style you're looking for?
CUSTOMER: Somewhat traditional.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The family portrait would include the five family members, all in traditional clothing. The background would be a solid color, either white or light blue. There would be a simple frame around the portrait.
