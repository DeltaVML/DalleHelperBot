DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I don't know, something cool I guess?
DALLE: Alright, let's start with what kind of vibe are you going for?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be kind of dark and mysterious.
DALLE: Okay, what kind of scene are you thinking of?
CUSTOMER: Maybe some kind of ruins or something?
DALLE: Okay, what kind of feeling do you want from the image?
CUSTOMER: I want it to feel really old and like there's a story behind it.
DALLE: Alright, what kind of effects are you looking for?
CUSTOMER: I want it to look like it's been rained on or something.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE
DALLE: The image is of an old, ruinous building with peeling paint and crumbling walls. The overgrown vegetation and dark, stormy skies give the scene a dark and mysterious feeling. The building looks like it has been abandoned for many years and has a story to tell.
