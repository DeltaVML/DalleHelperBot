DALLE: The image is of a green and blue abstract logo. The logo is made up of two parts, a green circle and a blue triangle. The green circle is split into two halves, with the top half being slightly smaller than the bottom half. The blue triangle is overlapped by the green circle, with the top point of the triangle reaching the top of the circle. The bottom of the triangle extends past the bottom of the circle. There is a white space in the center of the logo where the two shapes overlap.
