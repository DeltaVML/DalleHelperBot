DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a landscape for my new game, but I don't know what kind of art style I want or what kind of location would be best.
DALLE: Do you have any ideas at all?
CUSTOMER: Well, I was thinking maybe something like a desert or a forest.
DALLE: Okay, that's a good start. What kind of feeling do you want the landscape to have?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be kind of mysterious, like there's something hidden just out of reach.
DALLE: Okay, that's a great idea. Do you want any specific elements in the landscape, like a castle or a mountain?
CUSTOMER: No, nothing specific. I just want it to be really pretty and mysterious.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
