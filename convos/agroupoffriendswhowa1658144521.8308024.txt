DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We just know we want a new painting for our apartment.
DALLE: Okay, well let's figure it out together. What are some of the things you and your friends like to do together?
CUSTOMER: We like to go hiking, play video games, and watch movies.
DALLE: Do you have any favorite movies or TV shows?
CUSTOMER: Yes, we love the Lord of the Rings movies and the Game of Thrones TV show.
DALLE: Okay, so based on that I'm thinking you might want a painting that has a lot of detail and is set in a fantasy or medieval-type world. Would that be something you're interested in?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
