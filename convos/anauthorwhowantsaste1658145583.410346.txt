DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I need a cover for my new book.
DALLE: Sure, what kind of book is it?
CUSTOMER: It's a romance novel.
DALLE: What kind of scene, setting, subject, style, feeling, and effects do you want?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be set in a garden, with the heroine and hero standing close together, looking longingly at each other. I want the feeling to be steamy and passionate.
DALLE: I can do that. Do you have any specific ideas about the camera lens and angle you want?
CUSTOMER: No, I'll leave that up to you.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
