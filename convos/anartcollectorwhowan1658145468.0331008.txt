DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just know that I want a new painting.
DALLE: Okay, well let's start with the basics then. What is the scene going to be?
CUSTOMER: It's going to be a landscape.
DALLE: What kind of landscape?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. Maybe something with rolling hills and a river?
DALLE: That sounds nice. What kind of feeling are you going for?
CUSTOMER: I want it to feel peaceful.
DALLE: Okay, so we'll definitely want to use soothing colors then. Are there any specific colors you have in mind?
CUSTOMER: No, not really. Just something that looks nice.
DALLE: Alright. What about the effects? Are you looking for anything specific?
CUSTOMER: No, not really. Just something that looks nice.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
