DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We just got engaged and we're looking for something special for our wedding.
DALLE: Okay, well let's start with the basics then. What's your budget?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We just want something unique and special that we'll cherish forever.
DALLE: Okay, well that's a good start. What kind of style are you looking for? Something traditional? Modern? Abstract?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We just want something that captures our love for each other.
DALLE: Well, that's a great place to start. What are some of your favorite memories together?
CUSTOMER: We love spending time outdoors, hiking and exploring. We also love traveling and experiencing new cultures.
DALLE: That sounds like a great foundation for a piece of art. Is there anything else you'd like to include?
