DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a book cover for my new steamy romance novel but I don't want anything too explicit.
DALLE: That's no problem. I can make something that's suggestive without being explicit. But I'll need to know more about the book. What's the scene, setting, subject, style, feeling, and effects that you're looking for?
CUSTOMER: Well, the book is set in a small town in the American south. It's about a young woman who falls in love with a bad boy. I'm thinking the scene should be something like them kissing in the rain. As for the style, I want something classic and romantic.
DALLE: I can definitely do that. And what kind of camera lens and angle would you like?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What do you suggest?
DALLE: Well, for a classic and romantic look, I would suggest a soft focus lens with a low angle.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect. Thank you so much!
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
