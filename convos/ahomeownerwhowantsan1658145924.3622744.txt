DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just know that I want something new for my living room.
DALLE: Okay, let's start there. What's the overall aesthetic of your living room?
CUSTOMER: It's very traditional. Lots of dark wood and Burgundy.
DALLE: Got it. And what are you looking for in a new piece of art?
CUSTOMER: Something that will really stand out, but still fit in with the overall look of the room.
DALLE: Any particular colors or subjects you're thinking of?
CUSTOMER: I really like blue, so maybe something with a lot of blue in it? And I love nature, so maybe something with a nature scene?
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
