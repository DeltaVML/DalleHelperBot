CUSTOMER: A photograph, I think.
DALLE: What kind of camera do you want to use?

CUSTOMER: A wide-angle lens, I think.
DALLE: What kind of angle do you want?
CUSTOMER: I want to be able to see the whole scene, but from a different perspective.
DALLE: Okay, I can do that. Do you want to be in the photograph?
CUSTOMER: No, I don't think so.
DALLE: Okay, I can take the photograph from a different angle then. Do you want the focus to be on a specific thing?
