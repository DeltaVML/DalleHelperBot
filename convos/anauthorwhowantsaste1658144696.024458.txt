DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a book cover for a steamy romance novel.
DALLE: I can't do sexual images, so we'll have to come up with something else. What's the book about?
CUSTOMER: Two people who fall in love and have a lot of steamy sex.
DALLE: What kind of scene do you want on the cover?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe something with them in bed together?
DALLE: What kind of feeling do you want the cover to convey?
CUSTOMER: I want it to look hot and sexy.
DALLE: I can do that. What kind of effects do you want?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe some lens flares or light effects?
DALLE: I can do that. Are you sure you don't want the cover to be too graphic?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that would be good.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
