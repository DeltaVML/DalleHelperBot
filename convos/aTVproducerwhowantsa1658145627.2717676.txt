DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a new opening title sequence for my TV show.
DALLE: OK, can you tell me a little bit about your show?
CUSTOMER: It's a comedy about a family of vampires who live in a small town.
DALLE: That sounds interesting. What kind of feeling do you want to convey in the opening title sequence?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be funny, but also a little spooky.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
