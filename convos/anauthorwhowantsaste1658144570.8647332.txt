DALLE: What can I make for you today?

DALLE: What kind of book is it?
CUSTOMER: Romance.
DALLE: What kind of romance?
CUSTOMER: Steamy.
DALLE: I'm sorry, I can't do sexual images.
CUSTOMER: What if the characters are just kissing?
DALLE: That's fine. What else can you tell me about the cover?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be mysterious.
DALLE: Okay. Do you want a background or just the characters?
CUSTOMER: Just the characters.
DALLE: What do you want them to be doing?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe they could be standing close together, looking into each other's eyes?
DALLE: Okay. Do you have any specific colors in mind?
CUSTOMER: Blue and silver.
DALLE: Anything else?
CUSTOMER: I think that's it.
