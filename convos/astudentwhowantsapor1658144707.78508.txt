DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I need a portrait of my family, but I don't know what kind of style or angle or anything.
DALLE: Okay, let's start with basics then. What is your family's ethnicity?
CUSTOMER: We're Hispanic.
DALLE: And how many people are in your family?
CUSTOMER: There are six of us.
DALLE: And how do you want the portrait to feel? Formal or informal?
CUSTOMER: I guess informal.
DALLE: What kind of background do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Maybe just a blank wall?
DALLE: Okay, and what kind of pose do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Just everyone standing?
DALLE: Okay, and are there any specific details you want in the portrait?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Just everyone looking happy, I guess.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
