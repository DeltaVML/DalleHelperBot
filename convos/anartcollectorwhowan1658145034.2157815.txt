DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want a new painting for my collection, but I don't know what I want exactly.
DALLE: That's okay! I'm happy to help you figure it out. Do you have any ideas about the scene, setting, or subject matter?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just know that I want something new and different.
DALLE: Okay. What about the style? Do you want something traditional or modern?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What are my options?
DALLE: Well, we could go for a traditional painting style, or we could try something more modern like abstract art.
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What do you think?
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
