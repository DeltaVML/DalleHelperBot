DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I need a book cover.
DALLE: What kind of book is it?
CUSTOMER: Romance.
DALLE: What kind of romance?
CUSTOMER: Steamy.
DALLE: I'm sorry, I can't do sexual images.
CUSTOMER: Okay, well how about a close-up of a man and woman kissing then?
DALLE: Sure, that I can do. What else do you need on the cover?
CUSTOMER: Just their heads, I think. And could you make the photo a little blurry?
DALLE: Sure, I can do that. Anything else?
CUSTOMER: Nope, that's it. Thank you!
