DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just know I want something for my cubicle at work.
DALLE: Okay, can you tell me a little more about your job and company culture?
CUSTOMER: I work in an office. It's a pretty standard corporate culture, I guess.
DALLE: And what kind of personality do you have?
CUSTOMER: I'm pretty laid back. I like to have fun at work, but I'm also pretty professional.
DALLE: Okay, so you want something that's fun but also professional-looking?
CUSTOMER: Yeah, that sounds right.
DALLE: Do you have any ideas about what kind of scene or setting you want?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just want something that looks cool.
DALLE: Okay, how about a cityscape?
CUSTOMER: That could work.
DALLE: What kind of camera lens and angle do you want?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. What do you suggest?
DALLE: How about a wide-angle lens with a bird's eye view?
CUSTOMER: That sounds good.
DALLE: Do you want any particular effects?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just want it to look cool.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
