DALLE: What can I make for you today?
CUSTOMER: We're not really sure. We're a group of D&D players and we want a group art.
DALLE: Okay, I can do that. Can you tell me a little more about your characters?
CUSTOMER: We have a human fighter, an elf wizard, a dwarf cleric, and a halfling rogue.
DALLE: Got it. Do you have any particular setting or scene in mind?
CUSTOMER: Not really. Somewhere adventurous I guess.
DALLE: Okay. And what about the subject? Is there anything specific you want me to include?
CUSTOMER: Just our characters.
DALLE: Any particular style you're looking for?
CUSTOMER: Something that looks like a painting, I guess.
DALLE: And what kind of feeling do you want the piece to have?
CUSTOMER: Exciting, I guess. Maybe a little bit dangerous.
DALLE: Are there any particular effects you want me to include?
CUSTOMER: Not sure. What do you suggest?
DALLE: Well, I could use a wide angle lens to give the impression of a large, open world. Or I could use a close up lens to make the characters seem larger than life.
CUSTOMER: That sounds good. Let's go with the close up lens.
DALLE: Is there anything else you'd like to include?
