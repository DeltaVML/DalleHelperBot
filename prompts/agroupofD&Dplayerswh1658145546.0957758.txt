The image is of a group of four adventurers, standing close together with their weapons drawn. The human fighter is in the forefront, with an elf wizard and dwarf cleric flanking him. Behind them is a halfling rogue, creeping up on something unseen. The characters are drawn in detail, with the close up lens giving them an imposing, larger-than-life quality. The background is left deliberately vague, with only a few hints of mountains or trees in the distance. The feeling of the piece is exciting and dangerous, with the close up lens adding a sense of immediacy to the scene.
