Across the bottom of the image, there should be a banner with the words "The Smith Family" written in gold lettering. The family should be posed in front of a white picket fence, with the dog and cat sitting in the grass in front of them. The parents should be standing, and the children should be sitting on the fence. The adults should be holding the children's hands. Lily, the cat, should be white with black spots, and the dog's fur should be golden.
