The image is of a blue and green abstract painting. The blue is a light sky blue and the green is a dark forest green. The painting is on a white canvas with black streaks throughout. It is hung on a light beige wall with a lot of sunlight coming in from the window. The painting is meant to be calming and is also a photography.
